    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase">Passphrases</a> are easier for people to remember and harder for computers to guess.
      A new, unique passphrase made up of simple, easy-to-type words is generated every time this page is refreshed.

    <p>
      They are not stored.

    <h2 class="u-center">Why?</h2>

    <p>
      Strong passwords are <em>still</em> too hard to create, remember, and enter.
      Many systems <em>still</em> suggest lengthy mixed case letters, numbers, and symbols even though those types of passwords are easier to crack.
      This quick, approachable tool takes the work out of devising passwords.
      Using the friendly passphrase above, you will be more secure.

    <h2 class="u-center">How?</h2>

    <p>Here is the process for creating these passphrases:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>select a random set of words from a collection (like a dictionary) to form a passphrase
      <li>analyze that passphrase with <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn">Dropbox’s open source password strength estimator</a>
      <li>
        <ol>
          <li>If it scores high enough, generate and store a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">cryptographic key</a> so the same combination won’t be shown again
          <li>If the score isn’t high enough or it has already been seen, construct another passphrase
        </ol>
    </ol>

      It is designed so you can easily use your own collection of words to make the passphrases even more special (and even more secure).
